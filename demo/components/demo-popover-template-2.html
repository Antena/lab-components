			Intently sniff hand instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail yet plays league of legends. Milk the cow sit by the fire. Paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked! yet run outside as soon as door open, but massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet stare at ceiling sun bathe. Hide when guests come over if it fits, i sits but burrow under covers, for paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away or my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor and tuxedo cats always looking dapper yet purrr purr littel cat, little cat purr purr.
